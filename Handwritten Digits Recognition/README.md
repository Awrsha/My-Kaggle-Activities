# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Machine Learning

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project aims to demonstrate the recognition of handwritten digits using various machine learning algorithms on the MNIST dataset. The project employs Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for digit classification. This README provides an advanced overview of the project, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.

## Project Description

The main objective of this project is to explore the performance of various machine learning algorithms in recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The algorithms used include Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Each algorithm is trained and tested on the dataset to evaluate its accuracy and efficiency in digit classification.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It consists of a training set with 60,000 examples and a test set with 10,000 examples. The dataset is included in Scikit-Learn and can be easily loaded using the provided functions.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awrsha/Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-with-ML.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-with-ML
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `DigitRecognition.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

## Running the Notebook

Inside the Jupyter Notebook, follow the step-by-step instructions to:

- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
- Train and test each machine learning algorithm.
- Evaluate the performance of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the results using various plots and charts.

Ensure you run each cell in the notebook sequentially for a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed results and analysis of each machine learning algorithm's performance on the MNIST dataset. You can find the accuracy and evaluation metrics for each algorithm, as well as visualizations of the results.
